The `caRey` package is a collection of R functions that may be useful in general data management or processing. 

### Installation
`caRey` can be installed using the `devtools` package:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nicholascarey/caRey")
```

### Functions

#### `progress()`

A simple progress bar function for use in loops or operations where you want some indication of progress and how long it will take. 

```{r eval = F}
## Simple example with custom message
for(i in 1:1000) {
    Sys.sleep(0.01) # pause or this example will be too quick
    progress(i, max = 1000, message = "Operation progress")
    }
```

```{r eval = T, echo = F}
    progress(500, max = 1000, message = "Operation progress")
```

#### `smooth()`

A general data smoothing function with several methods including moving average, splines, and loess regression. 

```{r eval = F}
smooth(sine_noisy.rd, method = "spline")
```

```{r eval = T, echo = F, out.width = '60%', fig.align='center', results='hide', fig.keep='all'}
smooth(sine_noisy.rd, method = "spline")
```

#### `peaks()`

A function that automatically identifies peaks (and troughs) in oscillating data, with several options for adjusting the detection sensitivity. 

```{r eval = F}
peaks(swim_y.rd, span = 5, smooth.method = "spline", smooth.n = 0.4, plot.which = "p")
```

```{r eval = T, echo = F, out.width = '60%', fig.align='center', results='hide', fig.keep='all'}
peaks(swim_y.rd, span = 5, smooth.method = "spline", smooth.n = 0.4, plot.which = "p")
```

#### `replace_tail()`, `replace_head()`

`replace_tail` is a simple solution for replacing the last `n` values in a vector. There are lots of ways of extracting the last `n` values, and a few of these can be used to replace them, but they are all not very elegant in code, leading to ugly examples such as: 

```{r eval = F}
## change last n values in x with 100
x[(length(x)-n+1):length(x)] <- 100
```

Instead, this function does the same job with either a value or vector

```{r eval = T}
# # Replace last 5 numeric values with single value
x <- 1:10
replace_tail(x, 5, 100)
```

``` {r eval = T}
# # Replace tail with a vector
x <- 1:20
replace_tail(x, r = 100:96)
```

Replacing the initial `n` values is much more straightforward in `R` syntax but `replace_head` makes a nice partner function and works the same way.
